# Community Review Data License v0.1 (Draft)

## 1. Purpose
This license governs user-generated restaurant review data submitted to
platforms implementing this project.

---

## 2. Ownership
Reviewers retain ownership of their individual reviews.

---

## 3. License Grant
By submitting a review, reviewers grant a non-exclusive, revocable license
to:
- Store and display reviews publicly
- Use reviews for aggregation and authority calculations
- Produce anonymized, derived data

---

## 4. Attribution
Reviews must be attributed to the reviewer’s chosen identity unless
explicitly anonymized.

---

## 5. Prohibited Uses
Raw reviews may not be:
- Sold or resold
- Licensed to data brokers
- Used for targeted advertising
- Used to train proprietary AI models without explicit opt-in

---

## 6. Derived Data
Derived data may be used and shared freely provided it cannot be reverse-
engineered to identify individual reviewers.

---

## 7. Deletion and Revocation
Reviewers may delete reviews at any time.
Deletion removes public display and future aggregation but does not
invalidate previously computed anonymized aggregates.

---

## 8. Portability
Reviewers may export their own review data in machine-readable formats.

---

## 9. Moderation
Platforms may remove or exclude reviews that violate community rules,
with documented and appealable processes.

---

## 10. Versioning
This license is versioned and applies prospectively only.
