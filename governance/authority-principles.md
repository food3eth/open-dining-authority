Authority Principles
for an Open-Source Restaurant Review Platform
1. Purpose
This project exists to create a credible, transparent, and community-governed restaurant review authority that is independent of proprietary platforms, advertising incentives, and opaque algorithms.
Authority is earned through methodology, not popularity.

2. Definition of Authority
In this system, authority is defined as:
The reproducible outcome of documented evaluation processes applied consistently by identifiable reviewers, governed openly and subject to audit.
No single review, reviewer, or algorithm constitutes authority on its own.

3. Transparency by Default
All of the following must be public, versioned, and reviewable:
* Review structure and prompts
* Scoring dimensions and weighting logic
* Reviewer reputation mechanics
* Governance and decision-making processes
Changes to any of the above require public documentation and rationale.

4. Separation of Concerns
To prevent conflicts of interest, the project explicitly separates:
* Code governance — how the software is built and maintained
* Data governance — how review data is collected, stored, and licensed
* Authority governance — how credibility, weighting, and methodology evolve
No single individual or entity controls all three.

5. Review Integrity
Reviews must be:
* Experience-based
* Structured and contextualized
* Time-bound (anchored to a visit)
Unstructured opinion, harassment, promotional content, and undisclosed conflicts of interest are excluded from authority calculations.

6. Reviewer Accountability
Reviewers are accountable to the system through:
* Persistent identities (real or pseudonymous)
* Reputation scores derived from longitudinal behavior
* Public contribution histories
Reputation is earned, adjusted, and revoked based on documented rules—not popularity or seniority.

7. Layered Authority Model
Authority emerges from multiple layers:
1. Community contributors
2. Verified experience reviewers
3. Peer-recognized high-reputation reviewers
4. Appointed stewards with defined, limited scope
No layer has absolute control. Higher layers amplify signal, not replace it.

8. Explainability Over Precision
Rankings and scores must be explainable in human terms.
When precision conflicts with transparency, transparency prevails.
Every score should be traceable to:
* Inputs
* Weighting
* Methodology version

9. Legal and Ethical Compliance
The project will:
* Use only legally accessible third-party signals
* Never store or redistribute copyrighted review text
* Clearly attribute external data sources where used
* Avoid dark patterns, pay-to-play, and undisclosed incentives
Legal compliance is treated as a design constraint, not an afterthought.

10. Open Evolution
This authority model is not static.
Methodology evolves through:
* Proposals
* Public discussion
* Documented decisions
* Versioned releases
Forks are permitted. Authority continuity is earned through trust and adoption.

11. Non-Goals
This project does not aim to:
* Maximize review volume
* Optimize for virality or engagement
* Replace professional critics
* Act as a marketing platform for restaurants
These goals conflict with long-term authority.
