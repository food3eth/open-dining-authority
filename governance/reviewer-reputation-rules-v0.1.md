# Reviewer Reputation Rules v0.1

## 1. Purpose
Reviewer reputation weights contributions based on historical reliability,
not popularity or credentials.

Reputation is earned over time and is reversible.

---

## 2. Core Principles
- Behavior over identity
- Transparency over discretion
- Longitudinal trust
- Non-transferability

---

## 3. Reputation Tiers

- R0: New Contributor
- R1: Established Contributor
- R2: Reliable Contributor
- R3: High-Trust Contributor
- R4: Steward-Eligible Contributor

Tiers are discrete and monotonic.

---

## 4. Reputation Increases

Reputation may increase when reviewers demonstrate:
- Consistent participation across venues
- Alignment with later consensus (lagged)
- Discriminative use of scoring scales
- Complete, careful submissions
- Repeated verified experiences

---

## 5. Reputation Decreases

Reputation decreases faster than it increases due to:
- Pattern abuse or review brigading
- Repeated moderation violations
- Undisclosed conflicts of interest
- Extended inactivity (decay)

Severe violations may permanently exclude reviews from authority calculations.

---

## 6. Neutral Events
The following do not affect reputation:
- Single disagreements with consensus
- Negative reviews of popular venues
- Positive reviews of unpopular venues
- Good-faith appeals

---

## 7. Promotion and Demotion
- Promotions require time, volume, and compliance
- Demotions may be automatic or steward-reviewed
- All changes are logged and auditable

---

## 8. Steward Eligibility (R4)
Eligibility does not imply appointment.
Stewards are time-limited, revocable, and documented.

---

## 9. Appeals
Reviewers may appeal exclusions or demotions.
Appeals require written justification and evidence.
